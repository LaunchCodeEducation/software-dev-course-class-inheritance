/*
Objective:
This activity will help students practice applying inheritance by creating a class hierarchy for a
library management system. Students will define a base class and extend it to create specialized
child classes that inherit and share behaviors and data.



Scenario:
You are tasked with designing a library management system. The library lends out various types of items
such as books, DVDs, and magazines. While all items share some common properties (e.g., title, id, isAvailable),
each type has unique properties and behaviors.
For example:
  Books have an author and a genre.
  DVDs have a director and duration.
  Magazines have an issueNumber and publisher.



Instructions:
Step 1: Create a Base Class
  Define a class LibraryItem to represent shared properties (title, id, isAvailable) and methods (e.g., checkOut() and returnItem()).

Step 2: Extend the Base Class
  Create child classes Book, DVD, and Magazine that inherit from LibraryItem.
  Add unique properties and methods for each child class:
  Book: Add properties like author and genre.
  DVD: Add properties like director and duration.
  Magazine: Add properties like issueNumber and publisher.

Step 3: Instantiate Objects
  Create instances of each class and test the shared and unique methods.

Step 4: Test the Inheritance
  Use inherited methods like checkOut() and returnItem() to manage the availability of items.
  Test accessing and displaying unique properties of each child class.
